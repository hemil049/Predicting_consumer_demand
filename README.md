# Sky Rose Marketing: Predicting Consumer Demand

## Introduction

### Cynthia Wright, a vice president at Skyrose Marketing Agency was leading a team of 4 associate to achieve excellent results in revenue generation and client satisfaction for Beverage Industry. Specifically, she was planning to implement the new Google Trends, a database of the search trend that spanned the last decade and could be used to proxy the consumer interest in the different product. By forecasting consumer interest, she wanted to predict demand from her clients.

## Problem 

### Cynthia planned to use the upcoming calendar year as a trial for the Google Trends approach for forecasting demand. To test its efficacy, she would access its influence on 3 key clients: Vintage Vino, On The Rocks and Downtown Brew Co.
### Vintage Vino, a wine producer and distributor had been working with the agency since last 3 years. As a leader in the market segment, the company was planning for the release of the new white wine in the upcoming year. Company was not sure when to release the new product to maximize the sales.

### On the Rocks Whiskey was likely to seek direction from Agency on upcoming market industry and consumer trend.  

### Downtown Brew Co. was rising star in craft beer industry. The company was expericing exponential growth and would like insights from agency on the consuemer trend.
